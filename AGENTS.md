# Agent Guide: Pyjo-Reactor-Winloop

## Overview

`Pyjo.Reactor.Winloop` is a reactor of Pyjoyment on the event loop of
Winloop, the fork of uvloop for Windows, in a distribution of its own, as
every reactor of Pyjoyment with a dependency is: Pyjoyment has no runtime
dependencies, and one reactor does not pull the dependencies of another. The
conventions are those of Pyjoyment: read its `AGENTS.md` in the checkout next
to this one, `../Pyjoyment/AGENTS.md`. The repository is made of the one of
Pyjo-Reactor-Uvloop, whose workflows and linters it shares, and whose
`AGENTS.md`, in `../Pyjo-Reactor-Uvloop`, says what the loop of uvloop needed.

## How it works

The reactor is not implemented yet: the module is the stub of the template,
whose constructor raises `NotImplementedError`, so that nothing falls back to
the loop of asyncio in the meantime. What it is to be:

- `Pyjo.Reactor.Uvloop` for Winloop: a subclass of `Pyjo.Reactor.Asyncio`
  that overrides `_own_loop` with a loop of Winloop, `winloop.Loop` or a
  subclass of it, in the place of `asyncio.new_event_loop()`.
- `_Loop` of `Pyjo.Reactor.Uvloop` works around the libuv and the uvloop that
  Winloop has too: the wakeup fd of the signals, the hook of the finalizer of
  an async generator in the debug mode, the poll after `stop`, the blocking
  mode of a handle and the error of a handle. Each of them is to be checked on
  Winloop, which is libuv on Windows, with its IOCP, and taken, changed or
  left out, as found, and written down here; the fork and `POLLERR` of Linux
  do not apply.
- What the reactor is for is the servers of Pyjoyment, `daemon` and
  `prethread`, as Windows has no fork for `prefork`, and its blocking user
  agent, where no loop runs and the reactor makes one.
- Winloop has wheels for CPython on Windows only, with the free-threaded
  build, not for PyPy, so the matrix of Tests is CPython 3.12 to 3.15 and
  3.15t on `windows-2025`.

## Development

The distribution depends on the release of Pyjoyment on PyPI, with the lowest
version that has what it uses, which `uv.lock` pins. A change of Pyjoyment that
is not released yet would be its Git repository in `[tool.uv.sources]` of
`pyproject.toml`, until its release, and not a path to the checkout next to
this one: uv applies the sources of a dependency of Git, so whoever installs
the reactor from Git would get a subdirectory of this repository that does not
exist. That is the Pyjoyment of `main` now, for its tests that recognize a
subclass of `Pyjo.Reactor.Asyncio`, pyjoyment/Pyjoyment#510: before a release
of the reactor, the source goes and the lowest version of `dependencies`
becomes the release of Pyjoyment that has it, as a wheel carries no sources of
uv and would install Pyjoyment 0.2.0.
The tests lay the checkout next to this one over it with `--with-editable`,
so that they test what is there:
Winloop is installed on Windows only, `sys_platform == 'win32'` of
`dependencies`, as it has wheels for Windows only, so the tests run on Windows,
and CI runs them on `windows-2025`; on Linux and macOS, where Trunk and Read
the Docs run, the environment has no Winloop.


```sh
mise exec -- uv sync
mise exec -- uv run --with-editable ../Pyjoyment python -m Pyjo.Prove -l -r t
```

Perl's `prove` runs them too, with `.proverc`, under `uv run`, whose `python`
is the one of the environment, where Pyjoyment and the reactor are installed,
so that it needs no `PYTHONPATH`, unlike in Pyjoyment:

```sh
mise exec -- uv run --with-editable ../Pyjoyment prove -r t
```

The tests of Pyjoyment run on this reactor as well, with `PYJO_REACTOR`:

```sh
cd ../Pyjoyment
PYJO_REACTOR=Pyjo.Reactor.Winloop mise exec -- uv run --project ../Pyjo-Reactor-Winloop --with-editable . \
  python -m Pyjo.Prove -l -j 4 -r t
```

The workflow Tests runs the tests of the reactor against the release of
`uv.lock`, without `--with-editable`, so that a pull request tests what an
installation gets, and the suite of Pyjoyment of the tag of that release on
the reactor, or of its commit when `uv.lock` has it from Git. A dispatch with
`pyjoyment-ref` lays a checkout of the ref over it, as in development, so
that what the next release of Pyjoyment breaks is known before the release.
It ends with the job `Tests`, the one check of it
that the ruleset of `main` requires, as in Pyjoyment: it fails when a job of
the matrix failed or was cancelled, so a new version of Python needs no change
of the ruleset.

Trunk checks the files with the linters of Pyjoyment, from `.trunk/trunk.yaml`:

```sh
trunk check --all
```

actionlint is the one of the maintained fork kjanat/actionlint, whose releases
continue those of rhysd/actionlint after 1.7.12, as in Pyjoyment: `downloads`
in `.trunk/trunk.yaml` replaces the URLs of the plugin with those of the fork,
whose files have the same names.

Biome formats and lints JSON, Markdown and YAML, with `biome.jsonc`, in the
place of prettier, markdownlint and yamlfmt, as in Pyjoyment, and yamllint
checks what Biome does not, as the duplicated keys. The version of Biome is
the pinned one of `.trunk/trunk.yaml`, where `!` keeps it from
`trunk upgrade`, and which Renovate bumps: the repository has no
`package.json` of its own. Renovate cannot run `biome migrate`, so the
workflow Biome Migrate runs it with `npx --yes @biomejs/biome@<version>` of
that version, migrates `biome.jsonc` on the branch of Renovate and commits it
with the token of the workflow, as the author that `gitIgnoredAuthors` of
`.renovaterc.json` names, so that Renovate keeps updating the branch, and
starts the checks of the commit with `workflow_dispatch`; anywhere else, a
`biome.jsonc` that this Biome would migrate fails the check. The definition of
Biome in `.trunk/trunk.yaml` is the one of Pyjoyment, which explains why it is
not the one of the plugin of Trunk.

Its pyright needs the environment of `uv sync`, `.venv`, which `tool.pyright` of
`pyproject.toml` names, as the reactor imports Pyjoyment and Winloop, while
Pyjoyment has no dependencies to find; Trunk Check of CI runs `uv sync` first.
The examples and the tests, and `docs/conf.py`, are not checked by pyright: for them it takes the
regular package `Pyjo` of Pyjoyment, which hides `Pyjo.Reactor.Winloop` of the
checkout.

The documentation is one page, `docs/index.rst`: the docstrings of the
module, which autodoc imports, and the examples from `examples/`, included,
never copied, as in Pyjoyment. Read the Docs installs it with `uv sync` of `uv.lock` and the
group `docs`, not with pip and a `docs/requirements.txt` as Pyjoyment does,
so that it builds with the versions of the lock, as the workflow Docs does.
The links to the modules of Pyjoyment come from intersphinx, to its stable
version from the stable one, and to latest from the others. The examples are
a rubric, not a section: they follow the docstring of the module, whose
sections are its own, so that a section would be a second title of the page.
The workflow Docs builds it with `-W`, as Read the Docs does, with the
Pyjoyment of `uv.lock`:

```sh
mise exec -- uv run --group docs --with-editable ../Pyjoyment sphinx-build -W --keep-going -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

`t/Reactor_Winloop.py` is to be `t/Reactor_Uvloop.py` of Pyjo-Reactor-Uvloop,
`t/Pyjo/Reactor_Asyncio.py` of Pyjoyment with subtests of its own, for the
loop of Winloop; it is a stub of the template now.
`t/docs/Reactor_Winloop.py` runs the synopsis of the module, in both forms, as
`t/docs` of Pyjoyment does.

## Releases

The releases are those of Pyjoyment, with its workflows: a release is a tag of
the version of `pyproject.toml`, without a `v`, as `0.2.0`, which Automated
version sets with `uv version`, the components of its `--bump` from a list, as
`patch dev` or `minor rc`, or the version of `manual`, in the pull request of
the branch `automated/version`. After a release, a pre-release goes with the
release that it comes before, as PEP 440 orders `0.2.0.dev1` before `0.2.0`,
so `dev` alone after `0.2.0` fails. Automated tag tags the merge commit of
that pull request when it is merged, or with a comment `/tag` of a maintainer
on it, and starts Release on the tag. A development version, as `0.2.1.dev1`,
is not tagged. The version is static in `pyproject.toml`, as `uv version`
cannot set a dynamic one, and `__version__` of the module reads it from the
metadata of the distribution.

Release builds the sdist and the wheel, attests their build provenance with
`actions/attest`, and makes a draft of the GitHub release with them, whose
notes are rewritten before it is published, and an SBOM in SPDX, attested
with them. The module bundles nothing, unlike the package of Pyjoyment, whose
SBOM lists the JavaScript libraries of its package, so the SBOM is what an
installation of the wheel gets: the distribution and its dependencies, as
Pyjoyment and Winloop, at the versions of `uv.lock`, installed in a virtual
environment of their own, which Syft scans. Syft on `uv.lock` itself would
take its dependency groups too, as Sphinx, which an installation does not get.
The sdist does not carry the SBOM, as the one of Pyjoyment does, as it is made
of the wheel, which is built after the sdist.

The workflow PyPI, run manually, publishes the files of the latest published
release, or of the release of the tag of its input, on PyPI once their
attestations of Release verify, in the environment `publishing`, which waits
for an approval and takes `main` and tags only. The trusted publisher of PyPI
names `pypi.yaml` and that environment.

```sh
gh attestation verify pyjo_reactor_winloop-0.2.0.tar.gz -R pyjoyment/Pyjo-Reactor-Winloop
```
